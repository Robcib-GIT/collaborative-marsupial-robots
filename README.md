Implementation of a method based on collaborative robots for ascending uneven terrains. A marsupial-type configuration is employed, wherein a higher-performance robot (equipped with a ramp) assists a smaller one in climbing towards an elevated area to proceed with an exploration process. This sequence is carried out through a state machine based on vision systems that governs from terrain characterization to the automatic ascent process.
